# oddjob-matchmaker
## capstone project
# Written by Alexander Sergjev


### After researching/planning this project I realize there is room for some pretty major stretch goals.
The mvp will require at least two paths with crud functionality.
Job seekers, and jobs.  

#### People will need to be able to post jobs (with best times to do them, price range, and location). They should also be able to look through a list of workers(with wage expectations, qualifications, ratings and contact information.) After the job is done they should be able to "grade" the quality based on things like timeliness, cleanliness, quality, etc)
#### Workers need to be able to post their profile with the above mentioned info, and look through a list of available jobs, again with the above mentioned info.
#### Because there has to be contact information, the site should require users to log in.

#### stretch goals include things like search by city, job type, cost range, etc.

#### Because of the potential complexity of the state shape of the site, react with redux will probably be necessary. This looks like it may be an ambitious project.

#### rundown of time spent:
